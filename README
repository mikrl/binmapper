This project aims to parse an objdump disassembly in such a way that it can be visualised as a control flow graph.
Currently it only supports x86 and x64 binaries that have not been stripped.
In the future I plan to add functionality for recovering information from a stripped binary.


Some TODOS:

     Link output to graphing software to create control flow graph
     Consolidate main method into a new executable class.
     Refactor code and add usage and license information within the program
     Add support for stripped binaries using instruction analysis
